# Ubuntu Build Docker Container

See more in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/mjmckinnon/ubuntubuild)

This is a container as a starting point for the build stage for the following projects:

* [docker-bitcoincore](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-bitcoincore)
* [docker-bitcoingold](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-bitcoingold)
* [docker-bitcoinsv](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-bitcoinsv)
* [docker-dogecoind](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-dogecoind)
* [docker-litecoin](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-litecoin)
* [docker-namecoin](https://github.com/mjmckinnon/docker-namecoin)

This ubuntubuild image is based on Ubuntu 20.04 with some additional packages that allow compilation of these above projects which are all essentially just forks of the bitcoin core project.
